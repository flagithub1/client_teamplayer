FULL STACK PROJECT:STAR LookApp:                                                   link to the server repository:https://github.com/flagithub1/rails-teamplayer

Star lookApp, as the name  suggests, it’s an app that let you interact, kinda ,with  the players of your your favorite team  after you signed up and become a member , i gotta be upfront about it, it’s a ...paid service app,  i know i know, because ,we’re dealing with public figures and privacy is a big deal ,so for this reason  we ‘re charging  a li’l fee of a thousand dollars :), and if you happen to be a season ticket holder, you get it  for free, just sign up, this app is highly secured to prevent any type of fraudulent activity, and violators will be prosecuted. This app is still in the building phase, you might get a bad request or not found if anybody without proper credentials try to access it.

List of technologies used so far:
Html, Css, JavaScript,  Jquery ,  Ajax, API, RAILS
That's the first phase of the project, eventually it will have the missing features,which i'm still working on ,stuff like adding the the players section,handlebars ,styling.
All that stuff require planning,which is always overlooked,but it's kinda like a map if you will,i don't know if it's because the list look intimidating,i still struggle with planning,but as many will testify,planning is a friend you want to have, but i'am a li'l bit better at it,and hopefully one day we can become best friends.

these are scenarios  that maybe going through a user or a fan's head
Logged out user:
As a logged out user i have to sign-up with email, password and password-confirmation

if email already taken, then show message(error)
-if password and password confirmation don't match, then show error message and clear form
-if email is unique and password and pwc match, then show success message and clear form
As a logged out user i should be able to sign-in with email and password
-if email is incorrect , then show error message and clear form
-if password is incorrect, then show error message and clear form
-if email and password are correct , then show success message and sign them in
As a logged in user
-i should be able to view  a team or players
-should be able to change my old pw to a new pw
i should be able to sign-out after watching my team

If you click on either link  below you'll see where it all started,ofcourse it looks a li'l different now, but the main idea is still there.
